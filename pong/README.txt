To run the project, compile and then program the FPGA in Quartus. In order to play the game, a USB keyboard will need to be plugged into the DE-10 Lite Shield.
Once the project has been compiled and programmed, launch Eclipse for NIOS and build the bsp/project as appropriate, and the go into run
configurations and run the program.

Before first play, press the reset key which is designated to KEY[0] on the FPGA.

Keyboard controls:
Pressing W will rotate the pieces as the fall.
Pressing S will accelerate the pieces downwards.
Pressing A/D will move the pieces left/right respectively.

To play again, simply preset the reset key.
